EE in store said they would have to have asked for £400+ up front if they have me the same deal. When I ordered on Thursday it said next delivery and sure enough I got it yesterday, brand new phone in box and a SIM in a new envelope. The deal really is as good as it sounds. Only improvement I would suggest is a confirmation of dispatch email, I had to message TheBigPhone on Facebook to find out what my dpd tracking number was, however rating 5 stars to offset the other excessively low ratings from people who clearly didn't go through with their purchase.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","worstRating":"1","ratingValue":"5"},"publisher":{"@id":"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1"},"inLanguage":"en"},{"@type":"Review","@id":"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Review/www.TheBigPhone.co.uk/5acf91fd6d33bc0abcb5edd8","itemReviewed":{"@id":"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.TheBigPhone.co.uk"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dan","url":"https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5ac7a20a4de5666d34fa90bd/"},"datePublished":"2018-04-12T17:06:05.000Z","headline":"AVOID SCAM AVOID!!!","reviewBody":"AVOID SCAM AVOID!!!My journey with this joke of a \"company\"....I used USwitch to find the best deals. I found an S8 for a good price (£30 pm Unlmtd mins/texts 8GB no upfront cost with EE). I ordered at 9:00am Friday, 6th April. I got a confirmation email (looks like it was written in notepad) with an order number saying that I would receive an email shortly when it had been dispatched - If I ordered before 7pm, I'd get next day delivery. Saturday and Sunday passed... No communication from them.Monday morning: I sent an email asking for an update. I then looked at reviews from other customers and my heart sank - I knew I was in for a rough ride. I called their \"Customer Services\" number using their 0333 number...  I became even more suspicious that a \"reputable company\" would use this prefix number for their services. Anyway, I sat in their call queue for 45 minutes. I was at position 6 for the entire time. I gave up and left it for the day hoping I'd get a response to my email.Tuesday: Nothing. No communications. I used their online form to contact them. I send this twice. I decided to call them again. After another 35 minutes of waiting in the queue, I reached position 2 in the queue - the call then cut off!!! So I called again... After another 40 minutes I FINALLY GOT THROUGH. I was advised that the phone was out of stock when I ordered it, but new stock had come in Monday night. The agent PROMISED to take ownership of my order and PROMISED it would be dispatched that day. I was told I would receive confirmation in the form of an email when this had been done.Wednesday: NOTHING. No comms.... I HAD TO CALL AGAIN. After another lengthily wait I was advised there was an issue with the SIM card from EE - IT HAD AN ERROR when they tried to register it. I LAUGHED AND LAUGHED. After asking if they would call EE that day to resolve the issue, I was told \"HOPEFULLY\". After thinking about it, all phones and SIM cards are sent factory packed, I became EVEN more suspicious... Anyway, they said they would resolve the issue for me that day and get it sent out that day. Thursday: NOTHING. I had to call them again... I asked if it's standard procedure to not update their customers with issues with their orders - All I got was \"not really\" - I cancelled my order. Well, I hope it's cancelled, as it's now been 7 hours since I rang them again and I've not received confirmation that it has been cancelled!! I went online, got the same deal for an extra 6 p/m via mobiles.co.uk - I received confirmation that my order had been received, 20 minutes later I got another email saying that it been approved and is awaiting dispatch. My phone new phone is now on route and will be here tomorrow (Friday 13th). Please, save yourself the grief and effort over a few quid a month and go elsewhere. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. IT'S A SCAM. I DOUBT THEY EVER HAD ANY INTENTION OF DELIVERING MY PHONE. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!TheBigPhone, If you'd like to reply (though, I doubt you will) my order number was : FH24546 - I WOULD LOVE AN EXPLANATION of your total incompetence.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","worstRating":"1","ratingValue":"1"},"publisher":{"@id":"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1"},"inLanguage":"en"},{"@type":"Review","@id":"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Review/www.TheBigPhone.co.uk/5acf48b16d33bc0abcb5cc80","itemReviewed":{"@id":"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.TheBigPhone.co.uk"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kate","url":"https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5874c0420000ff000a6aab36/"},"datePublished":"2018-04-12T11:53:21.000Z","headline":"Ridiculous customer service","reviewBody":"Got an email to call them to give more information after taking out contract online.

Following day I could not be home for delivery but DPD left me a consignment note with reference/tracking number. Unfortunately the tracking number was incorrect and refereed to completely different delivery for different address and according to DPD already completed few months ago. DPD also confirmed there was no active delivery in my name or my address. Bummer! I tried calling TheBigPhone but never got through, damn music and endless \"you are number X in our cue\". Then I found this page and after reading all the comments/reviews I freaked out and was ready to cancel the whole thing somehow. Once calmed down a little bit I started calling again and to my surprise after less than 10 minutes they answered and gave me correct DPD consignment number and delivery slot.

Ultimately they offer very good deals on the latest phones but everything else about them is really poor. I ordered a samsung galaxy s8 from them on Friday at midday. Was by far the best and cheapest deal I could find so went for it even though I'd  read similar reviews to the one I'm writing. I received a confirmation email straight away which stated they would email again to say when the phone had been \"despatched\" (ominous sign that they can't even spell the word dispatched!) It states on the website that if you order before a certain time then you can expect next day delivery. I didn't get an email to confirm this so called them before close of business. They said I'd ordered too late to get it the next day and it'd \"probably be Monday\". So no email on Sunday and no phone delivery on Monday. I called them again on Monday afternoon. This time I was on hold for 40 minutes, being told I was 6th in the queue, working my way down to first in the queue and then being told I was 6th in the queue again! Finally got through and was told the phone was out of stock, and their automatic email system was down (I doubt it exists). They said phone will be with me \"probably\" on Wednesday. Called to check on Tuesday if it had been dispatched and they said it had but \"couldn't give me a tracking number until the evening\". Phone did arrive and Wednesday and ultimately I got what I wanted/ordered and for very good value. Was just incredibly infuriating not being told when it would arrive so didn't know when to be in for delivery. If I'd have had any communication at all from them on what was happening then I wouldn't have minded at  all. Frustrating that I had to contact them to know what was happening. I imagine it would have been even worse if there was something wrong with the order. But ulitmately I've got my new phone and a very good deal.Think carefully before ordering.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","worstRating":"1","ratingValue":"2"},"publisher":{"@id":"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1"},"inLanguage":"en"},{"@type":"Review","@id":"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Review/www.TheBigPhone.co.uk/5ace15fb6d33bc0abcb56e3d","itemReviewed":{"@id":"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.TheBigPhone.co.uk"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Simon Galbraith","url":"https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/57b6ed550000ff000a3c4907/"},"datePublished":"2018-04-11T14:04:42.000Z","headline":"Lies & false promises","reviewBody":"Terrible company.

Of course EE wouldn't do this. It's a shame they didn't inform us of this scam at the start. I still have 30 days to run so they expected me to pay 2 lines. Never mentioned before either.

I had a few hiccups along the way, mainly with trying to get through to customer services. That is why they lost a star. When I did eventually get through to them, I have to say they were very polite and helpful. To improve I would just say maybe it would be helpful to answer emails to save people from calling. The other plus is, it is free to call not like another company that charged me 7 pounds for waiting to talk to someone. I hope they can sort there waiting times out for customer services and keep people updated with emails.  I received the galaxy s8, I ordered a black one but it was out of stock. So they could get it sent out quicker they asked if grey would be OK, I was more than happy with that. I don't think they are the only company to have long waiting times to get through to someone.

I had to chase numerous people to confirm that everything was fine but the Sales Rep at TheBigPhone Hayes store was extremely helpful in chasing the order and getting it delivered which turned up 3 days after ordering.Given the company seems a bit shady (you're paying almost half of what you would be paying if getting direct from the provider) my advice to them would be to confirm the delivery dates and let the customer know when they order if their chosen handset isn't in stock and if there may be some delay in delivery. The lack of true confirmation (in terms of tracking details etc) of when the delivery was going to occur, especially when given a lot of the reviews on here are related to slow delivery times, is the only reason this isn't a 5 star review.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","worstRating":"1","ratingValue":"4"},"publisher":{"@id":"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1"},"inLanguage":"en"},{"@type":"Review","@id":"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Review/www.TheBigPhone.co.uk/5acc73ad6d33bc0b90160f9c","itemReviewed":{"@id":"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.TheBigPhone.co.uk"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Adam","url":"https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5ac4b9ec4de5666d34e5d82a/"},"datePublished":"2018-04-04T11:41:33.000Z","headline":"Lies","reviewBody":"LiesOrdered new phone on the Monday, received no info at all form TheBigPhone, chased up over facebook claimed I should have emails.

They also raised a charge of £2.50 against the Debit card, which was not advised in the T&C's and they have not responded to the email querying this.Order has been cancelled as they do not appear to be a trustworthy organisation, the order will instead be placed directly with the service provider.**Update**  Having posted this review I had a very quick response from TheBigPhone via Trustpilot.  Despite advising them that my wife had emailed them just minutes before, there has still been no response to the email.  A missed phonecall, I assume as a result of the info I provided to them, was followed up by another email to advise them that communications are required via email, in order that there was a record, but still no response.  So very quick to portray willingness to deal with issues via Trustpilot, but not so willing when dealing directly with you.  We have just received a package with an address which traces back to a firm called Data Select, so we are assuming this is TheBigPhone.   This has a hastily printed label with a mal-formed addresss, so looks as though it was sent yesterday in response to my review. It's going back via registered post today.

that it was just bad communication so i ordered a note 8 for £38 a month, £50 upfront and 20gb data which is an insane deal. EE in store said they would have to have asked for £400+ up front if they have me the same deal. When I ordered on Thursday it said next delivery and sure enough I got it yesterday, brand new phone in box and a SIM in a new envelope. The deal really is as good as it sounds. Only improvement I would suggest is a confirmation of dispatch email, I had to message TheBigPhone on Facebook to find out what my dpd tracking number was, however rating 5 stars to offset the other excessively low ratings from people who clearly didn&#x27;t go through with their purchase.</p><p class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-black__5LYEn"

typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-black__5LYEn" data-service-review-text-typography="true">AVOID SCAM AVOID!!!<br/><br/>My journey with this joke of a &quot;company&quot;....<br/><br/>I used USwitch to find the best deals. I found an S8 for a good price (£30 pm Unlmtd mins/texts 8GB no upfront cost with EE). <br/><br/>I ordered at 9:00am Friday, 6th April. I got a confirmation email (looks like it was written in notepad) with an order number saying that I would receive an email shortly when it had been dispatched - If I ordered before 7pm, I&#x27;d get next day delivery. <br/><br/>Saturday and Sunday passed... No communication from them.<br/><br/>Monday morning: I sent an email asking for an update. I then looked at reviews from other customers and my heart sank - I knew I was in for a rough ride. I called their &quot;Customer Services&quot; number using their 0333 number...  I became even more suspicious that a &quot;reputable company&quot; would use this prefix number for their services. Anyway, I sat in their call queue for 45 minutes. I was at position 6 for the entire time. I gave up and left it for the day hoping I&#x27;d get a response to my email.<br/><br/>Tuesday: Nothing. No communications. I used their online form to contact them. I send this twice. I decided to call them again. After another 35 minutes of waiting in the queue, I reached position 2 in the queue - the call then cut off!!! So I called again... After another 40 minutes I FINALLY GOT THROUGH. I was advised that the phone was out of stock when I ordered it, but new stock had come in Monday night. The agent PROMISED to take ownership of my order and PROMISED it would be dispatched that day. I was told I would receive confirmation in the form of an email when this had been done.<br/><br/>Wednesday: NOTHING. No comms.... I HAD TO CALL AGAIN. After another lengthily wait I was advised there was an issue with the SIM card from EE - IT HAD AN ERROR when they tried to register it. I LAUGHED AND LAUGHED. After asking if they would call EE that day to resolve the issue, I was told &quot;HOPEFULLY&quot;. After thinking about it, all phones and SIM cards are sent factory packed, I became EVEN more suspicious... Anyway, they said they would resolve the issue for me that day and get it sent out that day. <br/><br/>Thursday: NOTHING. I had to call them again... I asked if it&#x27;s standard procedure to not update their customers with issues with their orders - All I got was &quot;not really&quot; - I cancelled my order. Well, I hope it&#x27;s cancelled, as it&#x27;s now been 7 hours since I rang them again and I&#x27;ve not received confirmation that it has been cancelled!! <br/><br/>I went online, got the same deal for an extra 6 p/m via mobiles.co.uk - I received confirmation that my order had been received, 20 minutes later I got another email saying that it been approved and is awaiting dispatch.

Following day I could not be home for delivery but DPD left me a consignment note with reference/tracking number. Unfortunately the tracking number was incorrect and refereed to completely different delivery for different address and according to DPD already completed few months ago. DPD also confirmed there was no active delivery in my name or my address. Bummer! I tried calling TheBigPhone but never got through, damn music and endless &quot;you are number X in our cue&quot;. Then I found this page and after reading all the comments/reviews I freaked out and was ready to cancel the whole thing somehow. Once calmed down a little bit I started calling again and to my surprise after less than 10 minutes they answered and gave me correct DPD consignment number and delivery slot. I got my new phone 30 minutes ago and all seems fine. Definitely not a SCAM, perhaps just not the best management and customer support. I was really worried but eventually i got what I wanted with just a minor communication issue.</p><p class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-black__5LYEn" data-service-review-date-of-experience-typography="true"><b class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_weight-heavy__E1LTj" weight="heavy">Date of experience<!-- -->:</b> <!-- -->12 April 2018</p></div></section></article></div><div class="styles_cardWrapper__LcCPA styles_show__HUXRb styles_reviewCard__9HxJJ"><article class="paper_paper__1PY90 paper_outline__lwsUX card_card__lQWDv styles_reviewCard__hcAvl " data-service-review-card-paper="true"><aside class="styles_consumerInfoWrapper__KP3Ra" aria-label="Info for James Goddard"><div class="styles_consumerDetailsWrapper__p2wdr"><div class="avatar_avatar__hmBp6 avatar_pink__GYN9_" style="width:44px;min-width:44px;height:44px;min-height:44px" data-consumer-avatar="true"><span class="typography_heading-xs__jSwUz typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_disableResponsiveSizing__OuNP7 avatar_avatarName__ehkAr">JG</span></div><a href="https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5acf294f4de5666d34217f46" rel="nofollow" name="consumer-profile" target="_self" class="link_internal__7XN06 link_wrapper__5ZJEx styles_consumerDetails__ZFieb" data-consumer-profile-link="true"><span class="typography_heading-xxs__QKBS8 typography_appearance-default__AAY17" data-consumer-name-typography="true">James Goddard</span><div class="styles_consumerExtraDetails__fxS4S" data-consumer-reviews-count="1"><span class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-subtle__8_H2l" data-consumer-reviews-count-typography="true">1<!-- --> review</span><div class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-subtle__8_H2l styles_detailsIcon__Fo_ua" data-consumer-country-typography="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="currentColor" class="icon_icon__ECGRl" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14px" height="14px"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M3.404 1.904A6.5 6.5 0 0 1 14.5 6.5v.01c0 .194 0 .396-.029.627l-.004.03-.023.095c-.267 2.493-1.844 4.601-3.293 6.056a18.723 18.723 0 0 1-2.634 2.19 11.015 11.015 0 0 1-.234.154l-.013.01-.004.002h-.002L8 15.25l-.261.426h-.002l-.004-.003-.014-.009a13.842 13.842 0 0 1-.233-.152 18.388 18.388 0 0 1-2.64-2.178c-1.46-1.46-3.05-3.587-3.318-6.132l-.003-.026v-.068c-.025-.2-.025-.414-.025-.591V6.5a6.5 6.5 0 0 1 1.904-4.596ZM8 15.25l-.261.427.263.16.262-.162L8 15.25Zm-.002-.598a17.736 17.736 0 0 0 2.444-2.04c1.4-1.405 2.79-3.322 3.01-5.488l.004-.035.026-.105c.018-.153.018-.293.018-.484a5.5 5.5 0 0 0-11 0c0 .21.001.371.02.504l.005.035v.084c.24 2.195 1.632 4.109 3.029 5.505a17.389 17.389 0 0 0 2.444 2.024Z"/><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M8 4a2.5 2.5 0 1 0 0 5 2.5 2.5 0 0 0 0-5ZM4.5 6.5a3.5 3.5 0 1 1 7 0 3.5 3.5 0 0 1-7 0Z"/></svg><span>GB</span></div></div></a></div></aside><hr class="divider_divider__M85e9 styles_cardDivider__42s_0 divider_appearance-subtle__DkHcP"/><section class="styles_reviewContentwrapper__zH_9M"><div class="styles_reviewHeader__iU9Px" data-service-review-rating="2"><div class="star-rating_starRating__4rrcf star-rating_medium__iN6Ty"><img alt="Rated 2 out of 5 stars" src="https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-2.svg"/></div><div class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-subtle__8_H2l styles_datesWrapper__RCEKH"><time dateTime="2018-04-12T09:39:35.000Z" class="" data-service-review-date-time-ago="true">12 Apr 2018</time></div><div class="styles_reviewLabels__nHPUT styles_reviewLabels__Ym2vM"></div></div><div class="styles_reviewContent__0Q2Tg" aria-hidden="false" data-review-content="true"><a href="https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5acf29576d33bc0abcb5bf70" rel="nofollow" target="_self" class="link_internal__7XN06 typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-inherit__TlgPO link_link__IZzHN link_notUnderlined__szqki" data-review-title-typography="true"><h2 class="typography_heading-s__f7029 typography_appearance-default__AAY17" data-service-review-title-typography="true">Think carefully about what you want…</h2></a><p class="typography_body-l__KUYFJ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-black__5LYEn" data-service-review-text-typography="true">Think carefully about what you want before you buy from phonehouse. Ultimately they offer very good deals on the latest phones but everything else about them is really poor. <br/><br/>I ordered a samsung galaxy s8 from them on Friday at midday. Was by far the best and cheapest deal I could find so went for it even though I&#x27;d  read similar reviews to the one I&#x27;m writing. I received a confirmation email straight away which stated they would email again to say when the phone had been &quot;despatched&quot; (ominous sign that they can&#x27;t even spell the word dispatched!) It states on the website that if you order before a certain time then you can expect next day delivery. I didn&#x27;t get an email to confirm this so called them before close of business. They said I&#x27;d ordered too late to get it the next day and it&#x27;d &quot;probably be Monday&quot;. So no email on Sunday and no phone delivery on Monday. <br/><br/>I called them again on Monday afternoon. This time I was on hold for 40 minutes, being told I was 6th in the queue, working my way down to first in the queue and then being told I was 6th in the queue again! Finally got through and was told the phone was out of stock, and their automatic email system was down (I doubt it exists). They said phone will be with me &quot;probably&quot; on Wednesday. Called to check on Tuesday if it had been dispatched and they said it had but &quot;couldn&#x27;t give me a tracking number until the evening&quot;.<br/><br/> Phone did arrive and Wednesday and ultimately I got what I wanted/ordered and for very good value. Was just incredibly infuriating not being told when it would arrive so didn&#x27;t know when to be in for delivery. If I&#x27;d have had any communication at all from them on what was happening then I wouldn&#x27;t have minded at  all. Frustrating that I had to contact them to know what was happening. I imagine it would have been even worse if there was something wrong with the order.

I rang asking about an upgrade and was offered a good deal. I was told the phone was in stock, my new minutes and Internet usage upgraded immediately and that the phone would be with me with in a day or two. After numerous times sat in a long queue on the phone and an ignored email I&#x27;ve just got through. So me and apparently some other customers aren&#x27;t getting our new phones! Shame they forgot to tell us. TheBigPhone apparently had knowingly been selling people who wanted an EE upgrade the EE new phone tariff in the belief they didnt need to inform the customer and that EE would still let the order through!! Of course EE wouldn&#x27;t do this. It&#x27;s a shame they didn&#x27;t inform us of this scam at the start. I still have 30 days to run so they expected me to pay 2 lines. Never mentioned before either. The staff sound great when you talk to them and are friendly and polite so my advise I&#x27;d you choose to buy from them is check that everything they are selling is legit otherwise stay clear.</p><p class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-black__5LYEn" data-service-review-date-of-experience-typography="true"><b class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_weight-heavy__E1LTj" weight="heavy">Date of experience<!-- -->:</b> <!-- -->11 April 2018</p></div></section></article></div><div class="styles_cardWrapper__LcCPA styles_show__HUXRb styles_reviewCard__9HxJJ"><article class="paper_paper__1PY90 paper_outline__lwsUX card_card__lQWDv styles_reviewCard__hcAvl " data-service-review-card-paper="true"><aside class="styles_consumerInfoWrapper__KP3Ra" aria-label="Info for saz"><div class="styles_consumerDetailsWrapper__p2wdr"><div class="avatar_avatar__hmBp6 avatar_pink__GYN9_" style="width:44px;min-width:44px;height:44px;min-height:44px" data-consumer-avatar="true"><span class="typography_heading-xs__jSwUz typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_disableResponsiveSizing__OuNP7 avatar_avatarName__ehkAr">SA</span></div><a href="https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5ac6232f4de5666d34d2bcb1" rel="nofollow" name="consumer-profile" target="_self" class="link_internal__7XN06 link_wrapper__5ZJEx styles_consumerDetails__ZFieb" data-consumer-profile-link="true"><span class="typography_heading-xxs__QKBS8 typography_appearance-default__AAY17" data-consumer-name-typography="true">saz</span><div class="styles_consumerExtraDetails__fxS4S" data-consumer-reviews-count="6"><span class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-subtle__8_H2l" data-consumer-reviews-count-typography="true">6<!-- --> reviews</span><div class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-subtle__8_H2l styles_detailsIcon__Fo_ua" data-consumer-country-typography="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="currentColor" class="icon_icon__ECGRl" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14px" height="14px"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M3.404 1.904A6.5 6.5 0 0 1 14.5 6.5v.01c0 .194 0 .396-.029.627l-.004.03-.023.095c-.267 2.493-1.844 4.601-3.293 6.056a18.723 18.723 0 0 1-2.634 2.19 11.015 11.015 0 0 1-.234.154l-.013.01-.004.002h-.002L8 15.25l-.261.426h-.002l-.004-.003-.014-.009a13.842 13.842 0 0 1-.233-.152 18.388 18.388 0 0 1-2.64-2.178c-1.46-1.46-3.05-3.587-3.318-6.132l-.003-.026v-.068c-.025-.2-.025-.414-.025-.591V6.5a6.5 6.5 0 0 1 1.904-4.596ZM8 15.25l-.261.427.263.16.262-.162L8 15.25Zm-.002-.598a17.736 17.736 0 0 0 2.444-2.04c1.4-1.405 2.79-3.322 3.01-5.488l.004-.035.026-.105c.018-.153.018-.293.018-.484a5.5 5.5 0 0 0-11 0c0 .21.001.371.02.504l.005.035v.084c.24 2.195 1.632 4.109 3.029 5.505a17.389 17.389 0 0 0 2.444 2.024Z"/><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M8 4a2.5 2.5 0 1 0 0 5 2.5 2.5 0 0 0 0-5ZM4.5 6.5a3.5 3.5 0 1 1 7 0 3.5 3.5 0 0 1-7 0Z"/></svg><span>GB</span></div></div></a></div></aside><hr class="divider_divider__M85e9 styles_cardDivider__42s_0 divider_appearance-subtle__DkHcP"/><section class="styles_reviewContentwrapper__zH_9M"><div class="styles_reviewHeader__iU9Px" data-service-review-rating="4"><div class="star-rating_starRating__4rrcf star-rating_medium__iN6Ty"><img alt="Rated 4 out of 5 stars" src="https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-4.svg"/></div><div class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-subtle__8_H2l styles_datesWrapper__RCEKH"><time dateTime="2018-04-10T16:41:39.000Z" class="" data-service-review-date-time-ago="true">10 Apr 2018</time></div><div class="styles_reviewLabels__nHPUT styles_reviewLabels__Ym2vM"></div></div><div class="styles_reviewContent__0Q2Tg" aria-hidden="false" data-review-content="true"><a href="https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5acce9436d33bc0abcb510df" rel="nofollow" target="_self" class="link_internal__7XN06 typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-inherit__TlgPO link_link__IZzHN link_notUnderlined__szqki" data-review-title-typography="true"><h2 class="typography_heading-s__f7029 typography_appearance-default__AAY17" data-service-review-title-typography="true">Waiting times need sorting out</h2></a><p class="typography_body-l__KUYFJ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-black__5LYEn" data-service-review-text-typography="true">Ordered my phone from TheBigPhone because they had the best deals. I had a few hiccups along the way, mainly with trying to get through to customer services. That is why they lost a star. When I did eventually get through to them, I have to say they were very polite and helpful. To improve I would just say maybe it would be helpful to answer emails to save people from calling. The other plus is, it is free to call not like another company that charged me 7 pounds for waiting to talk to someone. I hope they can sort there waiting times out for customer services and keep people updated with emails.  I received the galaxy s8, I ordered a black one but it was out of stock. So they could get it sent out quicker they asked if grey would be OK, I was more than happy with that. I don&#x27;t think they are the only company to have long waiting times to get through to someone.

THEY NEED TO SORT OUT CUSTOMER SUPPORT WAITING WHERE ALL THE PROBLEM IS. the reason I have not given 4star is becasue i know if something goes wrong with phone how to contact them as its nightmare to contact them. you waste hours and hours.<br/>IMPORTANT THING IS I GOT VERY GOOD DEAL THATS WHY I INCREASED RATING TO 3 ...FURTHER  I WILL UPDATE AFTER FEW MONTHS AND DEPENDING ON FUTURE EXPERIENCE I

I had to chase numerous people to confirm that everything was fine but the Sales Rep at TheBigPhone Hayes store was extremely helpful in chasing the order and getting it delivered which turned up 3 days after ordering.<br/><br/>Given the company seems a bit shady (you&#x27;re paying almost half of what you would be paying if getting direct from the provider) my advice to them would be to confirm the delivery dates and let the customer know when they order if their chosen handset isn&#x27;t in stock and if there may be some delay in delivery. The lack of true confirmation (in terms of tracking details etc) of when the delivery was going to occur, especially when given a lot of the reviews on here are related to slow delivery times, is the only reason this isn&#x27;t a 5 star review.</p><p class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-black__5LYEn" data-service-review-date-of-experience-typography="true"><b class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_weight-heavy__E1LTj" weight="heavy">Date of experience<!-- -->:</b> <!-- -->04 April 2018</p></div></section></article></div><div class="styles_cardWrapper__LcCPA styles_show__HUXRb styles_reviewCard__9HxJJ"><article class="paper_paper__1PY90 paper_outline__lwsUX card_card__lQWDv styles_reviewCard__hcAvl " data-service-review-card-paper="true"><aside class="styles_consumerInfoWrapper__KP3Ra" aria-label="Info for Adam"><div class="styles_consumerDetailsWrapper__p2wdr"><div class="avatar_avatar__hmBp6 avatar_green__y0Z46" style="width:44px;min-width:44px;height:44px;min-height:44px" data-consumer-avatar="true"><span class="typography_heading-xs__jSwUz typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_disableResponsiveSizing__OuNP7 avatar_avatarName__ehkAr">AD</span></div><a href="https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5ac4b9ec4de5666d34e5d82a" rel="nofollow" name="consumer-profile" target="_self" class="link_internal__7XN06 link_wrapper__5ZJEx styles_consumerDetails__ZFieb" data-consumer-profile-link="true"><span class="typography_heading-xxs__QKBS8 typography_appearance-default__AAY17" data-consumer-name-typography="true">Adam</span><div class="styles_consumerExtraDetails__fxS4S" data-consumer-reviews-count="1"><span class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-subtle__8_H2l" data-consumer-reviews-count-typography="true">1<!-- --> review</span><div class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-subtle__8_H2l styles_detailsIcon__Fo_ua" data-consumer-country-typography="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="currentColor" class="icon_icon__ECGRl" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14px" height="14px"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M3.404 1.904A6.5 6.5 0 0 1 14.5 6.5v.01c0 .194 0 .396-.029.627l-.004.03-.023.095c-.267 2.493-1.844 4.601-3.293 6.056a18.723 18.723 0 0 1-2.634 2.19 11.015 11.015 0 0 1-.234.154l-.013.01-.004.002h-.002L8 15.25l-.261.426h-.002l-.004-.003-.014-.009a13.842 13.842 0 0 1-.233-.152 18.388 18.388 0 0 1-2.64-2.178c-1.46-1.46-3.05-3.587-3.318-6.132l-.003-.026v-.068c-.025-.2-.025-.414-.025-.591V6.5a6.5 6.5 0 0 1 1.904-4.596ZM8 15.25l-.261.427.263.16.262-.162L8 15.25Zm-.002-.598a17.736 17.736 0 0 0 2.444-2.04c1.4-1.405 2.79-3.322 3.01-5.488l.004-.035.026-.105c.018-.153.018-.293.018-.484a5.5 5.5 0 0 0-11 0c0 .21.001.371.02.504l.005.035v.084c.24 2.195 1.632 4.109 3.029 5.505a17.389 17.389 0 0 0 2.444 2.024Z"/><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M8 4a2.5 2.5 0 1 0 0 5 2.5 2.5 0 0 0 0-5ZM4.5 6.5a3.5 3.5 0 1 1 7 0 3.5 3.5 0 0 1-7 0Z"/></svg><span>GB</span></div></div></a></div></aside><hr class="divider_divider__M85e9 styles_cardDivider__42s_0 divider_appearance-subtle__DkHcP"/><section class="styles_reviewContentwrapper__zH_9M"><div class="styles_reviewHeader__iU9Px" data-service-review-rating="1"><div class="star-rating_starRating__4rrcf star-rating_medium__iN6Ty"><img alt="Rated 1 out of 5 stars" src="https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg"/></div><div class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-subtle__8_H2l styles_datesWrapper__RCEKH"><time dateTime="2018-04-04T11:41:33.000Z" class="" data-service-review-date-time-ago="true">4 Apr 2018</time></div><div class="styles_reviewLabels__nHPUT styles_reviewLabels__Ym2vM"></div></div><div class="styles_reviewContent__0Q2Tg" aria-hidden="false" data-review-content="true"><a href="https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/5acc73ad6d33bc0b90160f9c" rel="nofollow" target="_self" class="link_internal__7XN06 typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-inherit__TlgPO link_link__IZzHN link_notUnderlined__szqki" data-review-title-typography="true"><h2 class="typography_heading-s__f7029 typography_appearance-default__AAY17" data-service-review-title-typography="true">Lies</h2></a><p class="typography_body-l__KUYFJ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-black__5LYEn" data-service-review-text-typography="true">Lies<br/><br/>Ordered new phone on the Monday, received no info at all form TheBigPhone, chased up over facebook claimed I should have emails.

ahead with my purchase of a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 from TheBigPhone. With such a massive saving against ALL other providers you can be forgiven in thinking that there&#x27;s something not quite right (if it seems too good to be true, then it probably is!!!).<br/>But press ahead I did and I have nothing but positive things to say about the experience.<br/>I have made a considerable saving on the upfront cost &amp; over £20 per month on the tariff.<br/>I ordered my phone around 12:30 and had my confirmation email straight away. By 18:00 I had received my email confirming that the phone had been despatched &amp; was due for delivery the next day (which it was).<br/>I would definitely look to TheBigPhone the next time I look for my next phone deal.</p><p class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-black__5LYEn" data-service-review-date-of-experience-typography="true"><b

This order promised next day delivery however there was a slight blip in communications and this did not happen.  I did think the usual, should I have paid more and got the deal direct with the carrier but those thoughts went away after dealing with TheBigPhone customer service, a lady named Jordan Kirk.  Excellent customer service, callbacks when promised etc. You just don’t get service like this anymore.  I have just recommended this company to family and friends and would not hesitate to use again.  Support these companies not just the large corporates.</p><p class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-black__5LYEn"

They also raised a charge of £2.50 against the Debit card, which was not advised in the T&amp;C&#x27;s and they have not responded to the email querying this.<br/><br/>Order has been cancelled as they do not appear to be a trustworthy organisation, the order will instead be placed directly with the service provider.<br/><br/>**Update**  Having posted this review I had a very quick response from TheBigPhone via Trustpilot.  Despite advising them that my wife had emailed them just minutes before, there has still been no response to the email.  A missed phonecall, I assume as a result of the info I provided to them, was followed up by another email to advise them that communications are required via email, in order that there was a record, but still no response.  So very quick to portray willingness to deal with issues via Trustpilot, but not so willing when dealing directly with you.  We have just received a package with an address which traces back to a firm called Data Select, so we are assuming this is TheBigPhone.   This has a hastily printed label with a mal-formed addresss, so looks as though it was sent yesterday in response to my review. It&#x27;s going back via registered post today.  I cannot abide companies that ignore your emails.</p><p class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-black__5LYEn"

When I ordered on Thursday it said next delivery and sure enough I got it yesterday, brand new phone in box and a SIM in a new envelope. The deal really is as good as it sounds.

I found an S8 for a good price (£30 pm Unlmtd mins/texts 8GB no upfront cost with EE). \n\nI ordered at 9:00am Friday, 6th April. I got a confirmation email (looks like it was written in notepad) with an order number saying that I would receive an email shortly when it had been dispatched - If I ordered before 7pm, I'd get next day delivery. \n\nSaturday and Sunday passed... No communication from them.\n\nMonday morning: I sent an email asking for an update. I then looked at reviews from other customers and my heart sank - I knew I was in for a rough ride. I called their \"Customer Services\" number using their 0333 number...  I became even more suspicious that a \"reputable company\" would use this prefix number for their services. Anyway, I sat in their call queue for 45 minutes. I was at position 6 for the entire time. I gave up and left it for the day hoping I'd get a response to my email.\n\nTuesday: Nothing. No communications. I used their online form to contact them. I send this twice. I decided to call them again. After another 35 minutes of waiting in the queue, I reached position 2 in the queue - the call then cut off!!! So I called again... After another 40 minutes I FINALLY GOT THROUGH. I was advised that the phone was out of stock when I ordered it, but new stock had come in Monday night. The agent PROMISED to take ownership of my order and PROMISED it would be dispatched that day. I was told I would receive confirmation in the form of an email when this had been done.\n\nWednesday: NOTHING. No comms.... I HAD TO CALL AGAIN. After another lengthily wait I was advised there was an issue with the SIM card from EE - IT HAD AN ERROR when they tried to register it. I LAUGHED AND LAUGHED. After asking if they would call EE that day to resolve the issue, I was told \"HOPEFULLY\". After thinking about it, all phones and SIM cards are sent factory packed, I became EVEN more suspicious... Anyway, they said they would resolve the issue for me that day and get it sent out that day. \n\nThursday: NOTHING. I had to call them again... I asked if it's standard procedure to not update their customers with issues with their orders - All I got was \"not really\" - I cancelled my order. Well, I hope it's cancelled, as it's now been 7 hours since I rang them again and I've not received confirmation that it has been cancelled!! \n\nI went online, got the same deal for an extra 6 p/m via mobiles.co.uk - I received confirmation that my order had been received, 20 minutes later I got another email saying that it been approved and is awaiting dispatch.

Ultimately they offer very good deals on the latest phones but everything else about them is really poor. \n\nI ordered a samsung galaxy s8 from them on Friday at midday. Was by far the best and cheapest deal I could find so went for it even though I'd  read similar reviews to the one I'm writing. I received a confirmation email straight away which stated they would email again to say when the phone had been \"despatched\" (ominous sign that they can't even spell the word dispatched!) It states on the website that if you order before a certain time then you can expect next day delivery. I didn't get an email to confirm this so called them before close of business. They said I'd ordered too late to get it the next day and it'd \"probably be Monday\". So no email on Sunday and no phone delivery on Monday. \n\nI called them again on Monday afternoon. This time I was on hold for 40 minutes, being told I was 6th in the queue, working my way down to first in the queue and then being told I was 6th in the queue again! Finally got through and was told the phone was out of stock, and their automatic email system was down (I doubt it exists). They said phone will be with me \"probably\" on Wednesday. Called to check on Tuesday if it had been dispatched and they said it had but \"couldn't give me a tracking number until the evening\".\n\n Phone did arrive and Wednesday and ultimately I got what I wanted/ordered and for very good value. Was just incredibly infuriating not being told when it would arrive so didn't know when to be in for delivery. If I'd have had any communication at all from them on what was happening then I wouldn't have minded at  all. Frustrating that I had to contact them to know what was happening. I imagine it would have been even worse if there was something wrong with the order.
